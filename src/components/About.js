            <p><b>Samadhi</b>, (Sanskrit: “total self-collectedness”) in Indian philosophy
             and religion, and particularly in Hinduism and Buddhism, the highest state 
             of mental concentration that people can achieve while still bound to the body 
             and which unites them with the highest reality. Samadhi is a state of profound 
             and utterly absorptive contemplation of the Absolute that is undisturbed by desire,
              anger, or any other ego-generated thought or emotion. It is a state of joyful calm, 
              or even of rapture and beatitude, in which one maintains one’s full mental alertness
               and acuity. In Buddhism, samadhi is the last of the eight steps leading to enlightenment
                (the Eightfold Path).

            <p><b>Vipassana</b>, (Pali: “inner vision” or “insight meditation”). This practice requires intense
             concentration, which is thought to lead to a one-pointedness of mind that allows the meditator to gain
              insight into the saving truth that all reality is impermanent, permeated by suffering, and devoid of self.
               This insight, from the Buddhist perspective, allows the meditator to progress toward the attainment of nirvana itself.
